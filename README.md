# wbs-plus-hypercast

## Peer-to-peer live video with advanced realtime editing? On the web? You bet!

A truly web-based broadcasting experience. Requires [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/).

[WBS](https://github.com/RationalCoding/Web-Broadcasting-Software) allows for an OBS-like experience for the broadcaster.

[Hypercast](https://github.com/RationalCoding/hypercast-browser) streams the video over the P2P Dat protocol.

## Demo

1. Go to [https://rationalcoding.github.io/wbs-plus-hypercast/](https://rationalcoding.github.io/wbs-plus-hypercast/).

2. Add some sources and press "Start Streaming".

3. Move sources and change streams while broadcasting, just like you would on OBS.

4. Share the link in the top left to let anyone watch your broadcast over the Dat protocol!
